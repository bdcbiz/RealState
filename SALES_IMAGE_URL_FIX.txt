Issue: Sales API returning localhost URLs instead of production URLs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ PROBLEM:

Sales API was returning image URLs with localhost:
  "images": [
    "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_0.webp",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_1.webp",
    ...
  ]

This caused images to fail loading in the production app.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 ROOT CAUSE:

SalesController.php had hardcoded localhost URL:
  Line 20:  $baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage";
  Line 156: $baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage";
  Line 264: $baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage";

This was used in 3 methods:
  - index() - Get all sales
  - show() - Get single sale
  - getCompaniesWithSales() - Get companies with sales

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SOLUTION:

Changed hardcoded localhost to dynamic URL helper:

BEFORE:
  $baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage";

AFTER:
  $baseUrl = url('/storage');

The url() helper automatically uses APP_URL from .env:
  APP_URL=https://aqar.bdcbiz.com

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📁 FILE MODIFIED:

app/Http/Controllers/SalesController.php
  ├── Line 20:  Changed to url('/storage')  - index() method
  ├── Line 156: Changed to url('/storage')  - show() method
  └── Line 264: Changed to url('/storage')  - getCompaniesWithSales() method

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ RESULT:

NOW returning production URLs:
  "images": [
    "https://aqar.bdcbiz.com/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_0.webp",
    "https://aqar.bdcbiz.com/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_1.webp",
    "https://aqar.bdcbiz.com/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_2.webp",
    ...
  ]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 VERIFICATION:

Test Command:
  curl https://aqar.bdcbiz.com/api/sales | jq '.sales[0].images[0]'

Expected Output:
  "https://aqar.bdcbiz.com/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_0.webp"

NOT:
  "http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/compound-images/88/compound_88_img_0.webp"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 AFFECTED ENDPOINTS:

All now returning production URLs:

1. GET /api/sales
   → All sales with production image URLs

2. GET /api/sales/{id}
   → Single sale with production image URLs

3. GET /api/companies-with-sales
   → Companies with sales, all using production image URLs

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 WHY THIS MATTERS:

Before Fix:
  - App tries to load: http://127.0.0.1:8001/storage/...
  - This points to localhost (developer machine)
  - Images fail to load (404 error)
  - User sees broken images in app

After Fix:
  - App loads: https://aqar.bdcbiz.com/storage/...
  - This points to production server
  - Images load correctly
  - User sees proper sale images

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 CONSISTENCY:

Now ALL controllers use production URLs:
  ✅ CompoundController - url() helper
  ✅ UnitController - url() helper
  ✅ SalesController - url() helper ⬅️ FIXED
  ✅ Company Model - url() helper

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ COMPLETE STATUS:

All Sales API Endpoints:
  ✅ Images appearing (not empty array)
  ✅ Prices showing correctly (old_price, new_price)
  ✅ Image URLs using production domain
  ✅ Images loading correctly in app

All Compound API Endpoints:
  ✅ Salesperson data included (name, email, phone)
  ✅ Image URLs using production domain

Activity Logging:
  ✅ All changes tracked automatically
  ✅ Available via /api/activities endpoints

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Date: 2025-10-22
Status: ✅ FIXED - All image URLs now use production domain
