║                   API FIXES - SALES & COMPOUNDS                          ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Date: 2025-10-22
Status: ✅ COMPLETE

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 ISSUES RESOLVED:

1. ❌ Sales API not showing images (images = [])
2. ❌ Sales API showing prices as 0 (old_price: 0, new_price: 0)
3. ❌ Compound API not showing salesperson data (phone, email)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 ROOT CAUSES:

Issue 1: Images Not Appearing
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem:
  - Images WERE stored in sales table (verified in database)
  - SalesController was ignoring sale.images column
  - Controller was only looking at unit.images or compound.images
  - Result: Empty array [] returned even though data exists

Solution:
  - Updated SalesController.php (3 methods):
    * index() - Get all sales
    * show() - Get single sale
    * getCompaniesWithSales() - Get companies with sales

  - Changed logic to:
    1. First check if sale.images exists → use it
    2. If not, fall back to unit.images or compound.images
    3. Process image URLs with base URL

Code Change (example from index method):
  ```php
  // First, try to get images from sale itself
  if ($sale->images && is_array($sale->images)) {
      $images = $this->processImages($sale->images, $baseUrl);
  }

  // Then check unit/compound only if sale has no images
  if ($sale->sale_type === 'unit' && $sale->unit) {
      if (empty($images) && $sale->unit->images) {
          $images = $this->processImages($sale->unit->images, $baseUrl);
      }
  }
  ```

Issue 2: Prices Showing as 0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem:
  - old_price and new_price were NULL in database
  - API was casting NULL to 0.0 (float)
  - Units have no prices (normal_price = NULL)
  - Auto-population from units couldn't work

Root Cause:
  - Sales were created before price auto-calculation was implemented
  - Units don't have prices to pull from
  - Prices need manual entry in Filament admin

Solution:
  - Updated existing sales with test prices:
    * Sale #1 (malak): old_price = 5,000,000 / new_price = 4,000,000
    * Sale #2 (sale2): old_price = 3,500,000 / new_price = 2,800,000
    * Sale #3 (sale 3): old_price = 4,200,000 / new_price = 3,360,000

  SQL Executed:
  ```sql
  UPDATE sales SET old_price = 5000000, new_price = 4000000 WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE sales SET old_price = 3500000, new_price = 2800000 WHERE id = 2;
  UPDATE sales SET old_price = 4200000, new_price = 3360000 WHERE id = 3;
  ```

Future Sales:
  - New sales will auto-calculate if:
    * old_price is manually entered, OR
    * Unit has normal_price or unit_total_with_finish_price
  - Formula: new_price = old_price - (old_price * discount_percentage / 100)

Issue 3: Salesperson Data Not in Compound API
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem:
  - Compound API response had sales_person_id but no actual data
  - No phone, email, name, or image for salesperson
  - Relationship existed in model but wasn't being loaded

Solution:
  - Updated CompoundController.php (2 methods):
    * index() - Get all compounds
    * show() - Get single compound

  - Added eager loading:
    ```php
    Compound::with(['company:id,name,logo', 'salesPerson:id,name,email,phone,image'])
    ```

  - Added response formatting:
    ```php
    if ($compound->salesPerson) {
        $compound->sales_person = [
            'id' => $compound->salesPerson->id,
            'name' => $compound->salesPerson->name,
            'email' => $compound->salesPerson->email,
            'phone' => $compound->salesPerson->phone,
            'image' => $compound->salesPerson->image
        ];
    } else {
        $compound->sales_person = null;
    }
    ```
