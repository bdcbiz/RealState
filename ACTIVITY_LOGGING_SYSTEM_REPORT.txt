║              ACTIVITY LOGGING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION REPORT             ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED:

The app needs to track all updates (create, update, delete) to Sales, Compounds,
and Units so that users can see what's new and what's changed.

SOLUTION: Implemented a comprehensive activity logging system that:
  ✅ Automatically tracks all changes to Sales, Compounds, and Units
  ✅ Stores detailed information about each change
  ✅ Provides API endpoints for the app to retrieve activities
  ✅ Supports filtering by company, date, action type, and more

📊 DATABASE STRUCTURE:

New Table: activities
┌──────────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Column           │ Type            │ Purpose                            │
├──────────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
│ id               │ BIGINT UNSIGNED │ Primary key                        │
│ company_id       │ BIGINT UNSIGNED │ Which company (for filtering)      │
│ user_id          │ BIGINT UNSIGNED │ Who performed the action           │
│ subject_type     │ VARCHAR(255)    │ Model name (Sale, Compound, Unit)  │
│ subject_id       │ BIGINT UNSIGNED │ ID of the affected record          │
│ action           │ VARCHAR(50)     │ created / updated / deleted        │
│ description      │ TEXT            │ Human-readable description         │
│ properties       │ JSON            │ Detailed data (prices, changes)    │
│ created_at       │ TIMESTAMP       │ When activity occurred             │
│ updated_at       │ TIMESTAMP       │ Last update                        │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘

Indexes:
  - idx_company (company_id)
  - idx_user (user_id)
  - idx_subject (subject_type, subject_id)
  - idx_action (action)
  - idx_created (created_at)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 AUTOMATIC LOGGING:

All activities are logged automatically using Laravel Model Events:

1. Sale Model:
   ├── created: Logs when new sale is created
   │   → Tracks: sale_type, discount, old_price, new_price
   ├── updated: Logs when sale is updated
   │   → Tracks: what fields changed and their old values
   └── deleted: Logs when sale is deleted
       → Tracks: sale_type, discount

2. Compound Model:
   ├── created: Logs when new compound is created
   │   → Tracks: location, total_units
   ├── updated: Logs when compound is updated
   │   → Tracks: what fields changed
   └── deleted: Logs when compound is deleted
       → Tracks: project name

3. Unit Model:
   ├── created: Logs when new unit is created
   │   → Tracks: unit_type, usage_type, normal_price
   ├── updated: Logs when unit is updated
   │   → Tracks: what fields changed
   └── deleted: Logs when unit is deleted
       → Tracks: unit_code
